# RFM Customer Segmentation

This project uses sales data from Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce unicorn company. This project will focus on the use on database creation (PostgreSQL), querying data to perform RFM segmentation analysis.

## What is RFM analysis?
RFM analysis is a type of analysis used to determine the best customers based on their purchasing patterns. Customers are scored on these three categories:

- Recency how recent a customer made a purchase.
- Frequency: how frequent a customer makes a purchase.
- Monetary value how much monetary value a customer adds to the business/ how much money a customer spends on their purchases. 

RFM research enables businesses to anticipate which consumers are likely to buy their products again, how much income is generated by new (vs repeat) customers, and how to convert occasional purchases into habitual buyers.
